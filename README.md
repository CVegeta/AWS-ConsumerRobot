Welcome to the Consumer Robot Capstone Adventure

Overview

Hey there, fearless code warriors! Welcome to our wild ride through the exciting world of personal care robots, brought to you by the Chico State Capstone crew for the 2023-2024 school year. Get ready to dive headfirst into the madness of wires, sensors, and maybe a little bit of chaos.

About the Project

We present to you the Consumer Robot, the pinnacle of personal care robots. Because why settle for ordinary when you can have a robot to handle your daily pampering routine? This GitHub repository is your backstage pass to witness the magic happen, as we share, create, and debug the heck out of our code to bring this metallic marvel to life.

What's Inside

Codes Galore: Dive into the treasure trove of our brilliant and occasionally questionable code snippets. From sensors to servos, we've got it all covered. Brace yourselves for a rollercoaster of logic and the occasional "Eureka!" moment.

Setup Shenanigans: Unravel the mysteries of setting up our robot. Expect to encounter more wires than a mad scientist's lair, and just as much confusion. But hey, isn't that what makes it fun?

Bug Hunt Bonanza: Join us in the great bug hunt of 2023-2024! Together, we'll squash those pesky bugs and glitches, turning our robot from a potential menace to a helpful sidekick. Who knew debugging could be this much of an adventure?

How You Can Help

If you're feeling brave, strap in and contribute! We welcome all the brave souls who want to join us on this journey. Whether you're a coding wizard, a setup master, or just someone who enjoys the thrill of debugging, we want you on board.

üçÄ Good Luck Y'all!

To our fellow adventurers in code, best of luck navigating through the robot-infested terrain. May your code be bug-free, your sensors be sharp, and your wires be untangled. Let's make the Consumer Robot project a legendary success!
